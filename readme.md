Project Details:
------------------------------------------------------
This project is a website developing prototype for Healthy Goodness vending Machine Supplier company. Project is designed and developed by Evan Shajed from <a href="http://smedevelopers.com">SME Developers</a>

<b>How it is working?</b>
- HTML5 Boilerplate Framework has been used for optimal CSS and JavaScipt calls.
- HTML5 structure integrated with 960 grid CSS based grid system
- Design is CSS3; so please use non IE based web browsers. Yes I don't bother about IE and in many cases not even my Client. But still HTML5 is rendering well on IE8 without the CSS3 styles.
- You have to build and run the boilerplate optimisation script to make the tags even more optimized. check out the documentation for <a href="https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/wiki">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>

How you can work on this project?

Feel free to make any changes you would like to but will really appreciate if you don't copy the website as it is right now. Will also appreciate if you can share your developed prototype with others.

Thanks<br/>
