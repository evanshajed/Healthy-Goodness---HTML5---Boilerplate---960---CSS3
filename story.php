				<h1 class="big-title">Better Health, Better Taste<br/><span>About Simple Goodness.</span></h1>
			<p class="text-paragraph">
			Born and raised as the son of a school teacher who believed in eating healthy and living in environmentally ways by raising your own garden vegetables, avoiding artificial preservatives, composting, and recycling long before any of that was popular.  My dad taught us to eat fresh fruits and vegetables too.  We lived modestly, but ate healthy.
			</p>
			<p class="text-paragraph">
			When I was a little boy, taste was paramount.  Even if it was healthy, I wouldn't eat it if it tastes bad.  And today's not much different.  I think eating healthy should taste good.  That's why everything in our machines taste good or I won't offer it.  I feel like that's important for kids and adults alike.  Seriously, who wants to eat or drink something that tastes bad?  Not I.  That's why I personally sample everything I sell in the machines.

			The desire to start a healthy vending machine business began on my first sabbatical in Buenos Aires in the fall of 2011.  While there I was searching for a business that I could start that I would really believe in.  Something that would make a difference in people's lives and give back to the community.  Having had a passion for eating healthy and living well, I stumbled upon the concept through doing some research.
			</p>
			<p class="text-paragraph">
			I quickly realized the Nashville market was untapped and underserved.  Schools, gyms, and offices around the city increasingly sought to provide healthier foods and alternatives to the highly processed junk food that is currently offered in most vending machines.  But they had no viable option.  That's where I hope to step in and serve and make a difference in my community.
